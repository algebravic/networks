Various Algorithms to generate sorting networks
-----------------------------------------------

In Knuth (v. 3) exercise 5.3.4.38, it's stated that if we have a
sorting network with math:`n` elements, we can form a sorting network
of math:`mn` elements by replacing each of the comparators by an
math:`m` way merge network.
